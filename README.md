# youtube_show_full_title
This Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey user script ensures that long YouTube video titles (4+ lines) are displayed in full without overlapping other elements, even when YouTube dynamically updates its layout. It uses both CSS overrides and a MutationObserver to remove any inline styles that YouTube may apply to truncate titles.
